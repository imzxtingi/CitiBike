# CitiBike Data Analysis

## About the Project
**Overview:** I explored some patterns in the CitiBike data over a 6 month period from October 2023 to March 2024.  I examined the number of riders and the percent change between each of the months, the distribution of memberships, favorite starting and ending bike stations, and an interactive map.

## Analysis
**1. Ridership Records** \
\
October 2023 had the highest number of recorded riders while January 2024 had the lowest number.  This could be due to the changing weather in New Jersey.  As the winter months comes in, there are less riders than in warmer months like autumn and spring.  The day is also shorter during wintertime so the number of cyclists could decrease as they prefer to ride in the daylight.  The percent change between each month also reflects this as February had an increase in riders by around 10% and March had an increase by almost 20%.  There seems to be a general trend up in ridership as the weather turns warmers, therefore we can expect an increase in the following summer months as well.

**2. Distribution of Membership** \
\
The ridership records looks at the total number of riders over the 6 month period, however what is the distribution of members to casual riders? The graphic below shows that the majority of riders are members.  There are almost 4 times the amount of members to casual riders, but both of them prefer to ride classic bikes over electric ones.  If we look at the distribution of riders over the past 6 months, the curve follows very closely to what was previously observed--riders seem to prefer the fall and spring months over winter.

**3. Top 10 and Bottom 10 Bike Stations** \
\
The most popular bike stations don't change much from starting to ending trips.  Grove St. and Hoboken Terminal at River St. remain very popular starting and ending destinations.  This could be because these stations have more bicycles available or are closer to major cities and other methods of transportation, ie. bus stations/train stations/etc.

**4. Map of Starting and Ending Bike Stations** \
\
The following are maps of the starting and ending bike stations sized and colored by popularity.  The darker and larger circles indicate greater number of records.  There are filters available to toggle on/off to look at data according to desired date or by station name.  From the maps, you can see that Hoboken Terminal River St. station is near the Hoboken Terminal which is a transport interchange.  It is possible that this is the reason this terminal is so popular because after cycling, the rider can take the train, bus, or ferry back. The less popular stations tend to be farther away from metropolitan areas like Downtown New Jersey.
